# Codecademy OKCupid

In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these 
apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize 
the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth information that we've never had before 
about how different people experience romance. 

In this protfolio project, you will analyze some data from OKCupid, an app that focuses on using 
multiple choice and short answers to match users.

You will also create a presentation about your findings from this OKCupid dataset. 

The purpose of this project is to practice formulating questions and implementing machine learning 
techniques to answer those questions. However, the questions you ask and how you answer them are entirely
up to you.


Project objectives:
- Complete a project to add to your portfolio
- Use Jupyter Notebook to communicate findings
- Build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model
